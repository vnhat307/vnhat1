    <h1>My Skill</h1>
    <p>
      My skills are still developing as I continue to learn and improve.
      Although I am not very skilled in programming yet, I enjoy exploring it
      and building my knowledge step by step.<br />
      I also have a basic understanding of English and am working hard to
      improve my communication skills. I believe with consistent effort, I can
      achieve my goals and grow stronger in both areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      With my current role as a first-year university student and an aspiring
      programmer, I am focused on developing my skills in both areas.
      <br />Although I am still learning and not yet highly skilled in
      programming, I am eager to improve through practice and study.<br />
      In addition, I am working on building a stronger foundation in English to
      enhance my communication abilities. I understand that growth takes time,
      but I am committed to putting in the effort to achieve my goals.
